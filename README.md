## Additional Hardware/ and Cad files

### CAD
There is an additional cad files for the Sdcard and Ble module holder available.

### Additional Hardware
- DC to Dc Buck Converter 24V-5V
- HM10 Ble Module
- Arduino MicroSD Card Module
- MicroSD Card

### Electronics
Currently the electronics are only as schematics and as images.

Note:

My scematics are for an arduino micro since it was the only one laying around and it has integrated SPI and Serial pins. The code can be modified to use the arduino nano with the software serial library. If there is an interest for it add it as an issue.
